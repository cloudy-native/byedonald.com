He served in the Army. He was a veteran. But Trump said ‘criminals coming in’ in his statement, meaning into our country, and that is not accurate.”",

President Duda flew across the Atlantic for a planned hour-long meeting with Trump. He got 10 minutes. This wasn’t just bad optics. It was a humiliation. Poland has positioned itself as America’s most loyal ally in Europe. But when Trump is reshaping US policy on Ukraine and NATO, Poland was given barely a moment of his time. For years, Poland’s security strategy rested on unquestioning faith in the US alliance. That strategy is being dismantled day by day.” Polish PM Donald Tusk: “This is nothing to laugh at. Let’s be serious, because the situation is getting really serious.”",

He said senior DOJ official Emil Bove planned to intentionally ignore court orders on deportations. He said during a key meeting with several senior DOJ officials, Bove announced plans for Trump to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport a group of immigrants that weekend. Bove emphasized that the removal flights needed to depart “no matter what.” Anticipating possible judicial intervention, Bove said if a judge issued an order to halt the removals then DOJ might have to tell the courts “fuck you” and proceed with the deportations.",

After the summit, the CIA informed the analyst that she had lost her security clearance, effectively ending her career.

Modi traveled to China for the first time in 7 years after Trump’s abrupt move to impose 50% tariffs on India, half of them as punishment for New Delhi buying cheap Russian oil, sparked widespread outrage in India. These tariffs are higher than those enacted against China, America’s strategic rival, and have been accompanied by many statements by Trump admin officials that amplify Indian anger.

NYT: “The scope of the demolition, and Trump’s repeated promises that the WH itself would not be affected by the work, were in many ways symbolic of how he has conducted his presidency. On a variety of issues, Trump has blown past norms and traditions, often moving so quickly that it can be too late for courts, Congress or the public to catch up. He is also leaving his mark on the Oval Office, which now features many gilded flourishes. He also paved over the Rose Garden; erected huge flag poles on the WH grounds; and is planning to build an arch in the style of the Arc de Triomphe.”",

President Xi responded positively! 25% will be paid to the USA.” Chris McGuire, head of China policy for CFR: “This is a sea change in US policy, and a significant strategic mistake. If the US sells AI chips to China that are 18 months behind the frontier, it negates the biggest US advantage over China in AI.”",
